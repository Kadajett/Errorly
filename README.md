# Errorly
## This is a work in progress. 
I am using this in a production application, so it is getting regular updates, until it hits a solid point. I have some docs halfway done, so try to be patient until then. :) 

When this is done, it may/should include the following features. 

- Store all messages based on config file. 
- - Want errors to be stored in local storage? Do it. 
- - Want any debug messages to be sent to an external api? Do it. 
- - Want to store all message types in the same or different local storage documents? Already done. :P 
- - Want to send a certain type of message to Google Analytics? It is in development as you are reading this. 

## Good? Good. Feel free to make some PRs. <3
